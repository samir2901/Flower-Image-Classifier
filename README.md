This is a flower image classifier to classify five different kinds of flower.

This classifier uses a deep neural network (Convulational Neural Network) for classification.

Modules used are:
1. numpy
2. tensorflow
3. matplotlib
4. pickle

- flower_photos.tgz : This is a compressed file containing the actual flower images. Use 7zip use extract.
- Data Preparation.ipynb : This contains the code for preparing the data for model making.
- Data Output Pickle File.7z : This contains the datas in pickle format. Four files are there training images, training labels and test images and test labels.
- CNN Model.ipynb : This contains the code for neural model making and training.
